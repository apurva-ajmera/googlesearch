         For understanding this problem we have to take example.Let's assume that you are buying some thing at shop and at the time of bill payment you have some coins and you have to pay bill in that way so you have to give minimum number of coins to shopkeeper.So,the problem is you have many coins and with this you have to pay bill, so that you have to give minimum number of coins.
        </span>
       </p>
       <p style="text-align:justify">
        <span style="font-size:16px">
         Let's take an example,you have 1,2 and 5 rupees coin with many occurence that means you have many number of coin of 1,2 and 5 rupee coins.Assume that your total bill is 11 rupees and you have to pay bill by giving minimum number of coins from 1 rupee,2 rupee and 5 rupee coin.Before going to solve this problem using dynamic programming, first discuss what is brute force approach to handle this problem.

       </p>
       <p style="text-align:justify">
        <span style="font-size:16px">
         So, in brute force approach first you take 1 rupee coin.After that you take 1 rupee,2 rupee or 5 rupee coin to pay remaining amount.Again we take these three coins and again calculate remaining amount if it is not fulfill then again we take these three coins and calculate remaining amount.This process is continues untill we will not satisfie the problem means untill we can not get best solution for bill payment.You may think what is problem will occur here?For understanding this see below figure:-

        <span style="font-size:16px">
         In above figure(dotted line represents that this process is continue) you can see that for payment of 11 rupees we take one coin then second and then third.When we take coin one by one there is some problem occur.So,what is the problem?Therefore see above figure, in that figure tree is represnted as recurrence tree which describe brute force approach to solve given probllem.The problem is denoted by green line, as you can see in above figure that first we take 1 rupee coin and then 2 rupee coin but in second branch of tree we can see that first we take 2 rupee coin and then 1 rupee coin.So there is no importance of oredring a selection process of coin.Means either you select 1 rupee coin and second select 2 rupee coin or first select 2 rupee coin and then select 1 rupee coin there is no diffrenece between this process and it is called

          overlapping subproblem

         .In brute force approach there are many overlapping subproblem, overlapping means solving a problem many time with same input data.So,to overcome this problem we are using dynamic programming.

         By viewing video tutorial you can understand how dynamic programming solve given problem.For solving this we take one table where each cell represent one subproblem.Now our problem is that bill is 11 rupees and we have coins of 1,2 and 5 rupee.So,first we take one row from the table for 1 rupee coin and now we  pay 11 rupees, just by using 1 rupee coin so the total require coin is 11 .After that when we reach to second row,this row represent 2 rupee coin and when we reach to this row then we can use both coins which means we can use 1 rupee coin and 2 rupee coin.By using this two coins we require total 6 coins(5 coins of 2 rupee and 1 coin of 1 rupee).And then we reach to the last row, this last row for 5 rupee coin.And if we reach to last row then we can use any coin.So the answer is 3(2 coins of 5 rupee and 1 coin of 1 rupee).See below figure to understand this:-

       </p>
       <p style="text-align:justify">
        <span style="font-size:16px">
         You might think how can we fill this table?Initially we take one extra row and column which is 0 because we use it for further calculation.Now start with second row which is represent for 1 rupee coin.Every column reepresnts value so first column is 0 means no value therefore we put 0.In second column value is 1 so by using 1 rupee coin we can fulfill the value 1, so we take 1 rupee coin and now we calculate remaining amount which is zero so we go to first column which represent 0 value, take this position's(second row and first column) value and add 1 to this value.why add 1?because we already take one coin of 1 rupee.And if value is less than given coin then we take value from the above row.See third row which is for coin of 2 rupee.By using 2 rupee coin we can not pay bill of 1 rupee so we take value from the above row which is 1.
        </span>
       </p>
       <p style="text-align:justify">
        <span style="font-size:16px">
         Let's assume that you are at third row's last position, so the third row is represent 2 rupee coin and column is 11, so this cell represent one subproblem is that how many coins you require to fulfill the value 11 by using 1 rupee and 2 rupee coin?In above figure you can see that it gives answer as 6, by using only 2 rupee and 1 rupee coin you have to give 6 number of coin to pay bill of 11 rupees.But in our condition we have total 3 coins so we have to also see last row.In this problem last row and last column always gives the best answer.Here last column is 11 and lasrt row is 4 and calculated value is 3.And this is the answer as described in figure.So simple logic to fill this table is, if given value is less than coin then take value from the above row otherwise take coin and calulate remaining amount.

         Longest Common Subsequence(Dynamic Programming)

         In this problem you have given two strings.Let's take two strings one is "AGGTAB" and second is "GXTXAYB" and our task is to find out longest common subsequence.Note that here you have to find subsequence not a sequence that means matching string does not need to be continues in order to index.For above two strings the longest common subsequence is "GTAB".Before going to see the use of dynamic programming to solve this problem, first discuss brute force approach.
        </span>
       </p>
       <p style="text-align:justify">
        <span style="font-size:16px">
         So,what is the brute force approach to solve this problem?In this approach we take first strinng and then match each alphabet one by one adn then check if it is match then we take this character and remove it from the string and for remaining letter continue this process.When we reach to end of the string then we calculate the matched string's length, and then we can get the length of longest common subsequence.
        </span>
       </p>
       <p style="text-align:justify">
        <span style="font-size:16px">
         For implementing this brute force approach we have to use recursion.Create a function which have name "lcs" which compare the two strings.Call lcs function by passing argument of these two two strings.So, our function looks like lcs("AGGTAB","GXTXAYB").Now we compare two last alphabet or character of string, if it is match then we call this function like (1 + lcs("AGGTA","GXTXAY")), Why 1?Because we already get one character match from these two strings therefore we take 1 and for remaining calculation is added to this 1.And if it is not matched then we have to call two functions.For understaanding this see below figure:-
        </span>
       </p>
       <p style="text-align:justify">
        <span style="font-size:16px">
         <img alt="Longest common subsequence" src="/media/uploads/2020/04/20/lcs-rec.png" style="height:380px; width:596px"/>
        </span>
       </p>
       <p style="text-align:justify">
        <span style="font-size:16px">
         As you can see in above figure that in the root we call lcs function by passing two strings in arguments.At the time of comparision we compare last character from these two string, the last character of oth string is "B" so it is matched therefore we call 1 + lcs("AGGTA","GXTXAY").Now again we compare last character of these two strings but now first string last charcter is "A" and last character of second string is "Y", and it is not matched so we have to call two function, one is lcs("AGGTA","GXTXA")  and second is lcs("AGGT","GXTXAY").Why we call this two function becuase when last charcter is not matched then we can check that if first string's last charcter is matched with last character of second string(but before we have to remove last character "Y"), as we compare in first function and in second function we comapre last charaacter of second string with the last character of first string(but before we havee to remove last charcter which is "A").
        </span>
       </p>
       <p style="text-align:justify">
        <span style="font-size:16px">
         So this process is continue untill we can not get empty string from any side in function.If any side have empty string in function that means now there is no further match between these two strings.Dotted line represent that this tree is growing that means there is further calculation remaining.So what is the problem in this approach? the problem is that you can see in figure that there is two green arrow which represent same problem and these two subproblem call two times and also calculated two times.So there is problem of overlapping subproblem and there are many subproblems which can be overlapped when we do further calculation and therfore time complexity to solve this problem is O(2
         <sup>
          n
         </sup>
         ).
        </span>
       </p>
       <p style="text-align:justify">
        <span style="font-size:16px">
         Now assume that first string's length is n and second string's length is m, so there is maximum subproblem is (n+1)*(m+1) but here time complexity is O(2
         <sup>
          n
         </sup>
         ) when we solve this problem using brute force approach.In dynamic programming we take a matrix which have n+1 rows and m+1 columns.This matrix's first row and column is for empty string.Empty string can not match with any other string so we put 0 for first row and first column.If character of string is match then we take the diagonal cell of present in previous row and add 1 to that value and if it is not matched then we take maximum value from previous cell of this row or above cell fro this row.

         See in above figure and look at second row and third coluumn,row represent "G" and column represent "G" so this is match and therefore we take value of diagonal cell of previous row which is 0 and adding 1 to that value so total value is 1.Now look at 4
         <sup>
          th
         </sup>
         row 5
         <sup>
          th
         </sup>
         column which is "T" and it is also match so we take value of diagonal cell of previous row which is 1 and adding 1 to that value so total value is 2.What if character is not match.See lasr row and 6
         <sup>
          th
         </sup>
         column, where last row is "B" and 6
         <sup>
          th
         </sup>
         column represent "A" and that is not matching, in that case we take maximum value from previous cell of this row and above cell of this row.And that is how dynamic programming can solve this problem, here we can directly put the value of subproblem which is already calculated so it increase the performance and decrease the time complexity to solve this problem.
